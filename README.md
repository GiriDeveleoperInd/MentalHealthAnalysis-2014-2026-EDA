This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a workplace mental health survey dataset to understand patterns, trends, and relationships influencing mental health treatment among professionals.

The dataset contains 1,259 responses with a mix of demographic, workplace, and mental-health-related attributes, such as age, gender, work interference, family history, benefits, and treatment status.

Employees whose mental health interferes with work are significantly more likely to seek treatment

Individuals with a family history of mental illness show higher treatment rates

Availability of mental health benefits positively influences treatment-seeking behavior

The dataset is demographically and geographically skewed, which may affect generalization
